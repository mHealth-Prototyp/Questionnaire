This guide aims to explain how to build a FHIR Questionnaire, and in particular how to use the extensions necessary to make full use of the \`@i4mi/fhir-questionnaire-renderer\` library.

## Minimal Example

Your are free to set whatever fields you want inside your \`Questionnaire\` resource (note that the \`status\` field is mandatory), however only the following fields will be rendered by the Questionnaire Renderer:

- \`title\` the title of the questionnaire
- \`description\` the description as a markdown string
- \`item\` the array that contains the questions

\`\`\`json
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  "status": "draft",
  "title": "Basic Data Questionnaire",
  "description": "# How it works?\\n\\n Simply enter your date of birth and your name and press save!",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "Q1",
      "type": "dateTime",
      "required": true,
      "text": "Date of Birth"
    },
    {
      "linkId": "Q2",
      "type": "boolean",
      "required": true,
      "text": "Vaccinated against polio"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

For a more detailed and commented example, see the last chapter of this guide.

## Adding a question

To add a question, add an object inside the \`item\` array. Every question should have a unique \`linkId\` and a \`type\`. The rendering library supports the following subset of the [questionnaire item types](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-item-type.html):

- \`group\`
- \`display\`
- \`boolean\`
- \`decimal\`
- \`integer\`
- \`date\`
- \`datetime\`
- \`time\`
- \`string\`
- \`text\`
- \`url\`

### Required questions

To specify if a questionnaire item is required to be answered, set the field \`required\` to \`true\`.

For details, please see [the official documentation for enableWhen](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4b/questionnaire-definitions.html#Questionnaire.item.enableWhen).

### Answer options for choice questions

For choice questions, you can specify the potential answer options in the answerOptions field. Usually, it makes the most sense to use the valueCoding type here, but in this documentation we chose valueString for keeping it simpler.

\`\`\`json
{
  "linkId": "Q4",
  "type": "choice",
  "text": "Eye color",
  "repeats": false,
  "answerOptions": [
    {
      "valueString": "green"
    },
    {
      "valueString": "brown"
    },
    {
      "valueString": "blue"
    },
    {
      "valueString": "other"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

The \`repeats\` field declares if a choice question can have multiple answers or not. Set it to \`true\` to have a multiple choice question.

As an alternative to \`answerOptions\`, you can link to a ValueSet in the \`answerValueSet\` field with an \`#\` and the id of the contained value-set. The valueSet resource must be in the \`contained\` of the Questionnaire, external ValueSets are not supported as of now.

\`\`\`json
{
  ...,
  "answerValueSet": "#ORGAN-DONATION-LIST-ValueSet"
}
\`\`\`

### Subquestions

In a FHIR questionnaire, it is possible to have subquestions for a question. Just add the subquestion in the \`item\` field of the parent question. Of course, a parent item can have multiple subquestions, and the subquestions themselves can have subquestions again. This is rendered in a hierarchical way by the questionnaire renderer. If you want to display the subquestions depending from the answer given to the parent question, you have to declare them as depending questions (see next chapter).

\`\`\`json
{
  "linkId": "parent",
  "type": "boolean",
  "text": "Do you have children?",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "subQuestion",
      "type": "integer",
      "text": "How many children do you have?"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Depending questions

You can also dynamically enable or not some questions, depending on the status of other questions.

\`\`\`json
{
  "linkId": "Q3",
  "type": "date",
  "text": "Date of vaccination",
  "enableWhen": [
    {
      "question": "Q2",
      "operator": "=",
      "answerBoolean": true
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Initial values

You can also define an initial answer, that is preset to a question and can be changed by the user.

\`\`\`json
{
  "linkId": "initial",
  "type": "boolean",
  "text": "Do you want to receive our amazing newsletter?",
  "initial": [
    {
      "valueBoolean": true
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## Questionnaire Item UI Control Codes

It is possible to specify how questions should be rendered by adding an [extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl) to an element or to its child (see next chapters for more information).

Currently only the \`Help-Button\`, \`Prompt\` and \`Unit\` codes are supported. To see which items do support these codes, please refer on [documentation of fhir-questionnaire-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@i4mi/fhir-questionnaire-renderer).

For \`choice\` questions you can specify if the question should be rendered with radio control (one answer) or with checkboxes (multiple answer allowed) by adding an [extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl) directly to the question. If you do not use this extension on \`choice\` questions, they will be rendered as dropdown control and the \`repeats\` will be used to determine if it is or not a multiple answers question.

### Help Button

If you want to add explanatory/help text to a question, you can do so by adding an item with \`display\` element with the \`help\` [code](http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control) and \`questionnaire-itemControl\` [extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl) as described below.

The help element will take the form of an icon with a question mark which will display the text when hovering over it on a computer or pressing it on a mobile device.

\`\`\`json
{
  "linkId": "Q1-with-help",
  "text": "Where did you put your advanced directives?",
  "type": "text",
  "item": [
    {
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl",
          "valueCodeableConcept": {
            "coding": [
              {
                "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control",
                "code": "help",
                "display": "Help-Button"
              }
            ],
            "text": "Help-Button"
          }
        }
      ],
      "linkId": "H-Q1",
      "text": "Please, be precise e.g \u201DIn the middle drawer of my desk at my house.\u201D",
      "type": "display"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Prompt

If you want to add prompt/placeholder to an input question, you can do so by adding an item with \`display\` element with the \`prompt\` [code](http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control) and \`questionnaire-itemControl\` [extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl) as described below.

The prompt element will take the form of a text inside an input to give information about what should be entered.

\`\`\`json
{
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl",
      "valueCodeableConcept": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control",
            "code": "prompt",
            "display": "Prompt"
          }
        ],
        "text": "Prompt"
      }
    }
  ],
  "linkId": "P-Q1",
  "text": "Your advanced directive is ...",
  "type": "display"
}
\`\`\`

### Unit

If you want to add unit to an input question, you can do so by adding an item with \`display\` element with the \`unit\` [code](http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control) and \`questionnaire-itemControl\` [extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl) as described below.

The unit element will be displayed at the end of the input field as an indication of the unit of what the user should enter. Please not that the unit is only cosmetic, if you want to have an answer corresponding to an input with its unit, you should use a quantity item, but its not supported by this project.

\`\`\`json
{
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl",
      "valueCodeableConcept": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control",
            "code": "unit",
            "display": "Unit"
          }
        ],
        "text": "Unit"
      }
    }
  ],
  "linkId": "U-Q1",
  "text": "m / s ^ 2",
  "type": "display"
}
\`\`\`

### Check-box

If you want to render \`choice\` question with checkbox control, you can do so by adding the \`check-box\` [code](http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control) and \`questionnaire-itemControl\` [extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl) as described below.

\`\`\`json
{
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl",
      "valueCodeableConcept": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control",
            "code": "check-box",
            "display": "Check-box"
          }
        ],
        "text": "Check-box"
      }
    }
  ],
  "linkId": "Q1-",
  "type": "choice",
  "required": true,
  "repeats": true,
  "text": "I CONSENT to the removal of the following organs, tissues or cells, and to the associated preparatory medical measures:",
  "answerValueSet": "#ORGAN-DONATION-LIST-ValueSet"
}
\`\`\`

### Radio Button

If you want to render \`choice\` question with radio control, you can do so by adding the \`radio-button\` [code](http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control) and \`questionnaire-itemControl\` [extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl) as described below.

\`\`\`json
{
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl",
          "valueCodeableConcept": {
            "coding": [
              {
                "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control",
                "code": "radio-button",
                "display": "Radio Button"
              }
            ],
            "text": "Radio Button"
          }
        }
      ],
      "linkId": "Q1",
      "text": "In the event that removal of organs, tissues or cells is possible after my death, my wishes are as follows:",
      "type": "choice",
      "required": true,
      "repeats": false,
      "answerValueSet": "#ORGAN-DONATION-RESPONSE-ValueSet",
\`\`\`

## Internationalisation

To add internationalisation to a questionnaire, use the FHIR extension [translation](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/translation). The following is applicable for most text elements of a questionnaire (\`text\`, \`title\`, \`description\`, ...).
Please note, that for choice questions with answerOptions, internationalisation is not supported. In this case, you need to use an [answerValueSet with designation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation).

\`\`\`json
  "title": "Digital Organ Donation Card",
  "_title": {
    "extension": [
      {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/translation",
        "extension": [
          {
            "url": "lang",
            "valueCode": "de"
          },
          {
            "url": "content",
            "valueString": "Digitale Organspende-Karte"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/translation",
        "extension": [
          {
            "url": "lang",
            "valueCode": "fr"
          },
          {
            "url": "content",
            "valueString": "Carte num\xE9rique de don d'organes"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/translation",
        "extension": [
          {
            "url": "lang",
            "valueCode": "it"
          },
          {
            "url": "content",
            "valueString": "Carta digitale per la donazione di organi"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
\`\`\`

The \`@i4mi/fhir_questionnaire\` library will process the extension, see the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@i4mi/fhir_questionnaire) for more information.

## Prepopulation

Besides the initial value (see above), it is also possible to prepopulate the answers to the questions, using another FHIR resource with the information contained. The difference between initial values and prepopulation is that, with initial values, the preset answers are the same for every user, while with prepopulation, the answers can be set dynamically for every user, depending on the resource that is passed to the Questionnaire library. How the information is to be extracted from the passed resource is described in [FHIRPath](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/).

For this, you have to have the initialExpression extension in every item that should be prepopulated, with the FHIRPath expression that extracts the wanted value from the passed resource.

\`\`\`json
{
  "linkId": "populateExample",
  "text": "Birthdate",
  "type": "date",
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-initialExpression",
      "valueExpression": {
        "language": "text/fhirpath",
        "expression": "%patient.birthDate"
      }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Of course, you also have to pass the resource containing the information to the QuestionnaireData library. You can do this like this:

\`\`\`typescript
const fhirQuestionnaire = new QuestionnaireData(myQuestionnaire, languages); // fhirQuestionnaire is the instance of your QuestionnaireData
fhirQuestionnaire.populate(
  [myPatientResource], // the resources containing the needed information; you can only provide one resource of every ResourceType (e.g. Patient)
  true // true if you want to overwrite potentially already existing answers
);
\`\`\`

More information on prepopulating are found on the [@i4mi/fhir-questionnaire README](https://github.com/i4mi/fhir-questionnaire).

## Detailed example with comments

This is a detailled example using many of the concepts explained above. It is based on the organ donation questionnaire used in this app, however some redundancies are stripped out for better readability.
